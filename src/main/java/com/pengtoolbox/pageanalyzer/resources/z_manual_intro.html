<p>
	The Page Analyzer is a customized, YSlow setup based on <a target="_blank" href="http://yslow.org/">YSlow</a>, which provides various additional functionality.<br />
	<br />
	How it works:
	<ul>
		<li>It will analyze all the data present in the HAR-File and will present them in one statistic. </li>
		<li>You can analyze a single page or multiple pages. If you analyze multiple pages it will aggregate all the pages in the result. </li>
		<li>The rules and the analysis is highly customized and is not comparable to other YSlow tools.</li>
		<li>The rules rather blame to much, therefore it might give false positives.</li>
		<li>The results always have to be evaluated through some human mind(or other species with similar intelligence). As anyway each action you do in our application needs time, a rule might blame it even if it is the best way to do it in your page architecture.</li>
	</ul>
